                        <p> I want to be either an architect or a lawyer. One way to achieve my goal of being an arch is by taking physics in High School, so this way, the building that I might be designing doesnâ€™t fall over. I signed up to take an elective for advanced Speech and Debate in 7th grade. I really like to be creative and make the world a more stunning place by designing wowing buildings. I think that I am good with words, and a lot of people get stuck in citations and I want to help them. I am taking an elective for (advance)speech and debate in 7th grade. I am energetic and imaginative, which I think can really help in designing buildings. I am talkative and I think that my words have power for change.
